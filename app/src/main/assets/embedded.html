<h2>System</h2>
<p>A system is an arrangement in which all its unit assemble work together according to a set of rules. It can also be defined as a way of working, organizing or doing one or many tasks according to a fixed plan. For example, a watch is a time displaying system. Its components follow a set of rules to show time. If one of its parts fails, the watch will stop working. So we can say, in a system, all its subcomponents depend on each other.</p>
<h2>Embedded System</h2>
<p>As its name suggests, Embedded means something that is attached to another thing. An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system can be an independent system or it can be a part of a large system. An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task. For example, a fire alarm is an embedded system; it will sense only smoke.</p>
<p>An embedded system has three components &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p>It has hardware.</p></li>
    <li><p>It has application software.</p></li>
    <li><p>It has Real Time Operating system (RTOS) that supervises the application software and provide mechanism to let the processor run a process as per scheduling by following a plan to control the latencies. RTOS defines the way the system works. It sets the rules during the execution of application program. A small scale embedded system may not have RTOS.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So we can define an embedded system as a Microcontroller based, software driven, reliable, real-time control system.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of an Embedded System</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p><b>Single-functioned</b> &minus; An embedded system usually performs a specialized operation and does the same repeatedly. For example: A pager always functions as a pager.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Tightly constrained</b> &minus; All computing systems have constraints on design metrics, but those on an embedded system can be especially tight. Design metrics is a measure of an implementation's features such as its cost, size, power, and performance. It must be of a size to fit on a single chip, must perform fast enough to process data in real time and consume minimum power to extend battery life.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Reactive and Real time</b> &minus; Many embedded systems must continually react to changes in the system's environment and must compute certain results in real time without any delay. Consider an example of a car cruise controller; it continually monitors and reacts to speed and brake sensors. It must compute acceleration or de-accelerations repeatedly within a limited time; a delayed computation can result in failure to control of the car.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Microprocessors based</b> &minus; It must be microprocessor or microcontroller based.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Memory</b> &minus; It must have a memory, as its software usually embeds in ROM. It does not need any secondary memories in the computer.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Connected</b> &minus; It must have connected peripherals to connect input and output devices.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>HW-SW systems</b> &minus; Software is used for more features and flexibility. Hardware is used for performance and security.</p></li>

<h2>Basic Structure of an Embedded System</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows the basic structure of an embedded system &minus;</p>
<center><img src="images/embedded_systems_structure.jpg" alt="Embedded Systems Structure" height="300px" width="300px" /></center>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p><b>Sensor</b> &minus; It measures the physical quantity and converts it to an electrical signal which can be read by an observer or by any electronic instrument like an A2D converter. A sensor stores the measured quantity to the memory.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>A-D Converter</b> &minus; An analog-to-digital converter converts the analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Processor &amp; ASICs</b> &minus; Processors process the data to measure the output and store it to the memory.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>D-A Converter</b> &minus; A digital-to-analog converter converts the digital data fed by the processor to analog data</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Actuator</b> &minus; An actuator compares the output given by the D-A Converter to the actual (expected) output stored in it and stores the approved output. </p></li>
</ul>
