<h2>What are Robots?</h2>
<p>Robots are the artificial agents acting in real world environment.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Robots are aimed at manipulating the objects by perceiving, picking, moving, modifying the physical properties of object, destroying it, or to have an effect thereby freeing manpower from doing repetitive functions without getting bored, distracted, or exhausted.</p>
<h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
<p>Robotics is a branch of AI, which is composed of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science for designing, construction, and application of robots.</p>
<h3>Aspects of Robotics</h3>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p>The robots have <b>mechanical construction</b>, form, or shape designed to accomplish a particular task.</p></li>
    <li><p>They have <b>electrical components</b> which power and control the machinery.</p></li>
    <li><p>They contain some level of <b>computer program</b> that determines what, when and how a robot does something.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Components of a Robot</h2>
<p>Robots are constructed with the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p><b>Power Supply</b> &minus; The robots are powered by batteries, solar power, hydraulic, or pneumatic power sources.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Actuators</b> &minus; They convert energy into movement.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Electric motors (AC/DC)</b> &minus; They are required for rotational movement.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Pneumatic Air Muscles</b> &minus; They contract almost 40% when air is sucked in them.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Muscle Wires</b> &minus; They contract by 5% when electric current is passed through them.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Piezo Motors and Ultrasonic Motors</b> &minus; Best for industrial robots.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Sensors</b> &minus; They provide knowledge of real time information on the task environment. Robots are equipped with vision sensors to be to compute the depth in the environment. A tactile sensor imitates the mechanical properties of touch receptors of human fingertips.</p></li></ul>
<h2>Applications of Robotics</h2>
<p>The robotics has been instrumental in the various domains such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><p><b>Industries</b> &minus; Robots are used for handling material, cutting, welding, color coating, drilling, polishing, etc.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Military</b> &minus; Autonomous robots can reach inaccessible and hazardous zones during war. A robot named <i>Daksh</i>, developed by Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), is in function to destroy life-threatening objects safely.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Medicine</b> &minus; The robots are capable of carrying out hundreds of clinical tests simultaneously, rehabilitating permanently disabled people, and performing complex surgeries such as brain tumors.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Exploration</b> &minus; The robot rock climbers used for space exploration, underwater drones used for ocean exploration are to name a few.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Entertainment</b> &minus; Disneyâ€™s engineers have created hundreds of robots for movie making.</p></li>
</ul>
